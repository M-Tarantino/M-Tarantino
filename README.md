# Hi there, I'm M-Tarantino 👋

### 🛠️ The Journey: From Media Precision to Systems Engineering
My background is rooted in **Media Production**, where precision isn't just a goal—it's a requirement. From designing complex vector logos to the meticulous work of vinyl weeding and large-format production, I've learned that the smallest detail matters.

Today, I apply that same **attention to detail** to **System-Level Engineering with Rust**. I don't just write code; I architect solutions that are as clean and structured as a professional design project.

### 🔬 Current Focus: Project YETI
I am currently developing **YETI**, a specialized forensic suite for analyzing embedded firmware and automotive ECUs.
- 🦀 **Language:** Deep-diving into **Rust** for memory safety and performance.
- 🛡️ **Niche:** Firmware Forensics, Reverse Engineering & Modified Filesystems (SquashFS/JFFS2/ECUs).
- ⚙️ **Methodology:** Bringing professional project management (Agile/Kanban) to specialized forensic tools.
